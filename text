Abstract
Mastery learning promises more equitable outcomes in large CS
courses, yet instructors lack a full array of tools to support their
implementation. Popular Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs)
and adaptive platforms excel at grade analytics but offer limited
support for custom mastery policies. We present an open-source,
instructor-focused dashboard integrated into a custom LMS to sup-
port mastery learning for high-enrollment CS courses. The system
features a data pipeline that gathers scores from multiple sources
and provides a view into the effectiveness of equitable grading
policies, such as retakes, resubmissions, and flexible deadlines. The
central interface, the Students view, provides a way to see the
scores for a particular student across all assignments and exams. The
system was deployed for two semesters in a large introductory CS
course, where instructors reported ease of use, increased visibility
into class performance, and effective support for mastery-learning
policies. Based on this feedback, we are extending the platform
with a Statistics view that surfaces assignment–and concept-level
statistical summaries and interactive histograms to further support
scalable mastery learning. To support broader adoption, we plan to
release the system as an open-source platform to assist instructors
and institutions seeking to implement mastery learning at scale.

1 Background and Prior Work
LADs promise to provide actionable views of student progress at
scale [ 3]. Yet existing systems often fall short of supporting mastery
learning in higher education, where instructors need flexible, policy-
driven control over grading and progression.
Mainstream platforms provide only partial support. Canvas’s
Learning Mastery Gradebook summarizes rubric-aligned outcomes
into threshold levels [5 ], but does not natively support complex mas-
tery policies. Adaptive platforms such as Khan Academy and ALEKS
visualize topic-level mastery trajectories and recommend practice
activities, but these dashboards remain proprietary and inaccessible
for customization, limiting their applicability to university-level
courses [1, 7].
Beyond LMS-native tools, research systems such as SCALA and
CADA extend the scope of learning analytics by integrating data
across sources or surfacing participation metrics. SCALA generates
competency assessments by scraping data from existing LMSs [ 8 ],
while CADA provides instructor-facing views of student participa-
tion and discourse patterns in online discussions [9 ]. Although both
offer richer analytic perspectives than commercial LMS dashboards,
neither allows instructors to configure grading schemas, implement
mastery-based policies, or aggregate data across multiple platforms.

2 Approach
We present an instructor-facing dashboard designed for mastery
learning, integrated into our custom open-source LMS. The sys-
tem retains raw points, supports flexible policies such as infinite
retakes, aggregates performance by concept across assessments,

and integrates data from multiple platforms (e.g., LMS gradebooks,
autograders, spreadsheets).
Previously, we designed and deployed an LMS to support mas-
tery learning, similar to other developed open-source systems [2 ].
This platform provided students with a portal to view assignment
grades, track progress against course grade bins, and explore an
interactive Concept Map [ 4, 6, 10 ] to view their mastery levels. On
the instructor side, we implemented our proposed LAD: a secure
dashboard providing insight into both individual and class level
performance. Concretely, we designed a concept-centric dashboard
that (i) retains raw student points, (ii) composes data across multi-
ple platforms, and (iii) provides support for mastery learning (e.g.
infinite retakes, replacement policies, and incomplete grades).INTERFACEReference SheetInstructor InterfaceInstructor

Our platform pulls data from three sources, iClicker (attendance),
Gradescope (autogradable work), and PrairieLearn (exams and
homework), and consolidates them into a single Google Sheet – we
call our single-source-of-truth Reference Sheet. At regular intervals,
a “syncing” utility pulls raw scores via platform APIs and writes
them to the Reference Sheet, and another serves the instructor
dashboard from that sheet (Figure 2). LAD access is controlled by
instructor-managed permissions, so only designated TAs or instruc-
tors can view entries. By running scripts periodically and even
beyond the semester, we ensure that our system captures all resub-
missions and work submitted after flexible deadlines to support
retake policies and students with incomplete grades. Previously,
at our institution, this had to be administered manually through
dedicated TAs.
The main view of our web-based Instructor Dashboard is the
Students View (Figure 1). This view presents instructors with a
choice of all the students in the class whose grades they wish to
see. Once they choose a student, they see what the student would
see — grades for each assignment, tabular summaries of all grades,
and a Concept Map of the topics the student has not yet mastered.
3 Results
Once developed and tested, we deployed our custom LMS platform
with the instructor LAD in an introductory CS course at a large
public university for two consecutive semesters. Instructors dis-
tributed access to course staff through role-based permissions, and
the dashboard was used routinely to monitor student performance.
Despite serving several hundred students across multiple instruc-
tors and teaching assistants, the platform operated stably with min-
imal errors, demonstrating feasibility in high-enrollment settings.
Instructors reported that the Students view increased visibility into
class performance, was easy to use, and adequately supported their
mastery-learning policies. They also noted that it helped identify
struggling students earlier, enabling timely intervention. The auto-
mated data pipeline reliably captured resubmissions and late work,
reducing the need for manual TA oversight. Overall, the positive
feedback from instructors validated the dashboard’s utility for sup-
porting mastery learning at a university scale.
4 Future work
Based on the feedback, we are adding a Statistics View, providing
insight into class performance on each individual assignment, as
well as individual topics. It will provide statistical summaries includ-
ing mean, median, standard deviation, completion rates, percentiles,
and score ranges. Interactive histograms will allow instructors to
examine grade distributions in real time across an entire exam, or
one of the questions.
Another feature instructors have requested is to highlight strug-
ging students who haven’t submitted certain assignments, or who
scored below a certain threshold for targeted support (e.g., a group
help session). We are exploring ways to query our system to ex-
tract these lists. We plan to integrate the Statistics view into our
deployed platform and run pilot studies to assess its effectiveness.
Additionally, we plan to release an open-source version of our new
LAD integration with our LMS.
